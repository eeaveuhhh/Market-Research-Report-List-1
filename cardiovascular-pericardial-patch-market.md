<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiovascular Pericardial Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autologous</li><li>Xenograft</li><li>Synthetic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiovascular pericardial patch market includes three main types: autologous, xenograft, and synthetic patches. Autologous patches are derived from the patient's own pericardium, ensuring a compatible match and reducing the risk of rejection. Xenograft patches are sourced from animals, usually pigs, and are treated to minimize rejection. Synthetic patches, on the other hand, are made from artificial materials such as Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), offering a consistent and readily available solution. These different types cater to individual patient needs and preferences in cardiovascular surgical procedures.</p></p>

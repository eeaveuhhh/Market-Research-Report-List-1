<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) can be classified into two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors inside each tire to directly measure air pressure and temperature, providing real-time data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, uses the vehicle's ABS system to monitor tire pressure through wheel speed sensors. Both types of aftermarket TPMS offer drivers the ability to monitor tire pressure and temperature to improve safety, fuel efficiency, and overall vehicle performance.</p></p>

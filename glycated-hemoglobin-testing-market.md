<p><h1>Glycated Hemoglobin Testing Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Glycated Hemoglobin Testing Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Glycated hemoglobin testing, also known as HbA1c testing, is used to measure the average blood sugar levels over a period of 2-3 months. It helps diagnose diabetes or monitor the effectiveness of diabetes treatment. The test measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Higher levels of glycated hemoglobin indicate poor diabetes control.</p><p>The global glycated hemoglobin testing market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.00% during the forecast period. The market growth is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 463 million adults were living with diabetes in 2019, which is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045.</p><p>Technological advancements in glycated hemoglobin testing methods are also contributing to market growth. Automated testing systems and point-of-care testing devices provide quick and accurate results, making it easier for healthcare providers to monitor and manage diabetes. Additionally, the growing awareness about the importance of regular diabetes check-ups and the adoption of preventive healthcare measures are further propelling market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the necessity for glycated hemoglobin testing. People with diabetes are at a higher risk of severe illness from the virus, necessitating more frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels. This has increased the demand for glycated hemoglobin testing, leading to market growth.</p><p>In conclusion, the glycated hemoglobin testing market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years, driven by the global increase in diabetes prevalence, technological advancements, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fast Curing Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-fast</li><li>Non-water-tight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fast curing adhesives can be categorized into water-fast and non-water-tight types based on their resistance to water exposure. Water-fast adhesives are designed to withstand immersion in water without losing their bonding strength, making them suitable for use in moist or wet environments. On the other hand, non-water-tight adhesives may not perform well when exposed to water and are more suitable for dry applications where water resistance is not a requirement. Both types cater to different market needs and applications, offering solutions for a wide range of bonding requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-point injection</li><li>Continuous injection</li><li>Sequential injection</li><li>Direct injection</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-point injection refers to a fuel injection system that uses a single fuel injector to deliver fuel to all cylinders. Continuous injection involves a constant flow of fuel into the intake manifold. Sequential injection delivers fuel to each cylinder individually in a specific sequence. Direct injection injects fuel directly into the combustion chamber. Other types of injection systems include throttle-body injection and multi-point injection, which deliver fuel to multiple points in the intake manifold. Each type of injection system has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency and performance.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil & Gas Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravitational</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil & Gas Separator market mainly consists of two types: Gravitational and Centrifugal separators. Gravitational separators utilize the difference in density between oil, gas, and water to separate them, with oil typically floating on top, water settling at the bottom, and gas in the middle. On the other hand, Centrifugal separators use centrifugal force to spin the mixture and separate the components based on their weight. Both types are crucial in the oil and gas industry for efficient separation of fluids during extraction and processing.</p></p>

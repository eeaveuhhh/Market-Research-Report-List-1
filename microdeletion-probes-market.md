<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microdeletion Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Color</li><li>Multi-color</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microdeletion probes are used in genetic testing to detect abnormalities in chromosomes. Dual color probes use two different colored fluorophores to identify targeted sequences, providing clear and easy-to-interpret results. Multi-color probes use multiple fluorophores to target and detect multiple sequences simultaneously, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of genetic abnormalities. Both types of probes are widely used in clinical diagnostics and research to identify microdeletions associated with genetic disorders.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Printing Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scan Printing</li><li>Single-Pass Printing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet printing technologies are divided into two main market types: scan printing and single-pass printing. Scan printing refers to the traditional method where the print head moves back and forth across the paper, creating an image line by line. This method is commonly used in home printers. On the other hand, single-pass printing is a faster method commonly used in high-speed industrial printing. In this method, the print head remains stationary while the paper moves beneath it, allowing for faster printing speeds and higher productivity.</p></p>

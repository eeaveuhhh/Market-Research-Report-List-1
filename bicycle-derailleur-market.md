<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bicycle Derailleur Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front</li><li>Rear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bicycle derailleurs come in two main types: front and rear. Front derailleurs are located near the pedals and are responsible for shifting the chain between the chainrings. Rear derailleurs, on the other hand, are located near the rear wheel and help to shift the chain between the different gears on the cassette. Both front and rear derailleurs are crucial components of a bike's drivetrain system, allowing riders to easily change gears and maintain optimal pedaling efficiency.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductive Ceramics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-component</li><li>Multi-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductive ceramics can be classified into two main types: two-component and multi-component ceramics. Two-component ceramics consist of only two different elements, such as silicon carbide or gallium arsenide. These ceramics are simpler in composition and often exhibit predictable electrical properties. On the other hand, multi-component ceramics contain more than two elements, offering a wider range of property variations and customization possibilities. They are often more complex to manufacture but can provide enhanced performance for specific applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioprocess Integrity Testing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Destructive Testing</li><li>Non-Destructive Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioprocess integrity testing systems market consists of two main types: destructive testing and non-destructive testing. Destructive testing involves the complete destruction of the test sample in order to assess its integrity. This method is useful for determining the quality and strength of the sample, but renders it unusable after testing. On the other hand, non-destructive testing allows for the evaluation of the sample without damaging or altering it. This method is beneficial as it permits the sample's continued use after testing. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and safety of bioprocesses.</p></p>

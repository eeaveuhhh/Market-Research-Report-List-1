<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lab-Grown Diamonds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lab-grown diamonds are diamonds produced in a controlled environment rather than through natural processes. There are two main types of lab-grown diamonds in the market: CVD diamonds and HTHP diamonds. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) diamonds are created by growing diamond crystals in a chamber using carbon-rich gases. High Temperature High Pressure (HTHP) diamonds are produced by mimicking the high pressure and temperature conditions found in the Earth's mantle. Both types offer consumers a more sustainable and affordable alternative to mined diamonds.</p></p>

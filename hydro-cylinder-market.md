<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro-Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double-Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydro-cylinder market consists of two main types: single-acting and double-acting cylinders. Single-acting cylinders use hydraulic pressure to extend the piston, with another mechanism returning it to its original position. On the other hand, double-acting cylinders use hydraulic pressure to move the piston in both directions, providing more precision and control. Single-acting cylinders are commonly used for simple applications where force is only needed in one direction, while double-acting cylinders are preferred for more complex tasks requiring movement in both directions.</p></p>
